# Simple Neural Network

I aim to build a simple Neural Network from scratch based on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html). The sole objective is to understand the fundamentals of deep learning and to understand the backend implementation of the code.

### Usage
You need to install a few libraries to execute these codes. The dependencies are mentioned in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/khushi-411/simple-neural-network/blob/main/requirements.txt) and [environment.yml](https://github.com/khushi-411/simple-neural-network/blob/main/environment.yml). Please take a look!

To run the files:

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/khushi-411/knets.git
   ```
2. To train the model, run:
   ```
   python train_nn.py
   ```
3. To test the model, run:
   ```
   python test_nn.py
   ```

### Environment configuration
- CPU Model: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10870H CPU @ 2.20GHz
- RAM GB: 16
- Operating System: Manjaro Linux 21.1.1, Pahvo
